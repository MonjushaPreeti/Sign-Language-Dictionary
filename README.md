# Sign-Language-Dictionary
This project is a user-friendly sign language dictionary designed to assist deaf and mute individuals in learning Indian Sign Language (ISL). The application was developed using Python and Tkinter for its graphical user interface (GUI).

By integrating a JSON file linked to a public API that contains images of ISL signs, users can enter a letter into the app and instantly see the corresponding sign. This makes learning ISL easier and more accessible.

# Features
üìñ Interactive Dictionary: Users can input a letter, and the application displays the relevant ISL sign image.

üîó API Integration: The app fetches sign images dynamically via a public API for ISL.

üñ•Ô∏è GUI Built with Tkinter: A simple, intuitive interface that is easy for users of all ages to navigate.
## Why I Developed This
This dictionary was developed as a side project alongside my main project for my 3rd year, 2nd semester, which focused on a Sign Language Interpreter. The dictionary complements that project by offering a standalone tool for learning individual signs without real-time translation.

# Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for the app.
Tkinter: Used to create the graphical user interface.
JSON: Stores the sign data and links to the public API.
Public API: For fetching the sign language images.
# How It Works
Input: Users enter a letter into the app.
Fetch Data: The app uses the linked JSON file to find the relevant image URL from the public API.
Display: The corresponding ISL sign image is shown in the app.
